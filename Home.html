    <h1>    Project Explenation </h1>
    <p>
        I intend for the code for this project to result in an interactive map that gives information about current legislation related to data centers in the given state as well as an analysis of the viability of developing data centers in that state. I plan to do this by having the ChatGPT API search and analyze trends in local legislation. I worked on this project solo and all code and information provided for it were all written and collected by me.
